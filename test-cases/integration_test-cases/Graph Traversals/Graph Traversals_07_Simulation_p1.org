* Objective
  - To view the  Simulation of the Graph Traversals experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/data-structures-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Graph Traversals/Graph Traversals_01_Usability_smk.org][Graph Traversals_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the  Simulation link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the  Simulation page
  3. Click on the Graph DFS and BFS link
  4. Follow the tips and perform the simulation 
  5. Click on the Reset button and then click on the Board state button
  6. Click on the instructions button then click on the clear graph button
  7. Click on the clear board button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A new tab should be opened with the simulation process
  4. The result should be displayed on the screen and when we click on the reset graph button , the graph drawn should be erased 
  5. When we click on the Board state button , the result should be displayed on the screen and when we click on the instructions buttons , the instructions should be displayed on the screen
  6. When we click on the clear board button , all the nodes should be erased and simulation home page should be dispalyed on the screen
