* Objective
  - To view the  Simulation of the Sorting using Arrays experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/data-structures-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Sorting using Arrays/Sorting using Arrays_01_Usability_smk.org][Sorting using Arrays_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the  Simulation link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the  Simulation page
  3. Click on Quick Sort link
  4. Click on the Random Input link and and enter the values in the corresponding fields and click on enter button

* Expected result
  1. Simulatiion page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. Anew tab should be opened with the simulation oprocess
  4. when we click on Random input  link the simulation page should be displayed on the screen and the entered values should be displayed on the screen
  5. When we click on the enter button,resulst should be displayed on the screen
