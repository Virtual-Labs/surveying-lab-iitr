* Objective
  - To view the  Simulation of the Expression Trees experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/data-structures-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Expression Trees/Expression Trees_01_Usability_smk.org][Expression Trees_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the  Simulation link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the  Simulation page
  3. Click on the  Expression Tree link 
  4. Enter the values in the field either by keyboard or through the virtual keyboard and click on the "=" button
  5. Click on the pause button and then click on the play button 
  6. Click on the Pre-order , Inorder,post-order and again click on the pre-order link simultaneously
  7. Click on the clear(C) button

* Expected result
  1. Simulationpage should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A new tab shoul be opened with the simulation process
  4. When we click on the "=" button the video should start playing with the simulation process
  5. When we click on the pause button the  video should be paused and when we click on the play button the video should start playing
  6. When we click on the Pre-order link , the pre-order simulation preocess should start and it should be displayed on the screen
  7. When we click on the Inorder link , the Inorder simulation preocess should start and it should be displayed on the screen
  8. When we click on the Post-order link , the post-order simulation preocess should start and it should be displayed on the screen
  9. When we click on the Pre-order link , the pre-order simulation preocess should start and it should be displayed on the screen
  10. When we click on the clear(C) button, all the values should be erased and the simulation home page should be dispalyed on the screen.
