* Objective
  - To view the  Simulation of the Expression Trees experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/data-structures-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Expression Trees/Expression Trees_01_Usability_smk.org][Expression Trees_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the  Simulation link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the  Simulation page
  3. Click on the  Expression Tree link 
  4. Don't enter the values and click on the "=" button

* Expected result
  1. Simulationpage should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A new tab shoul be opened with the simulation process
  4. When we click on the "=" button , an error message should be displayed on the screen as to enter the valid values and then click on the '=' button
