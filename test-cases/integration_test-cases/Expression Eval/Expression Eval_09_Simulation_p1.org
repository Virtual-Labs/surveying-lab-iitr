* Objective
  - To  simulate the Minimum Spanning Trees experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/data-structures-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Expression Eval/Expression Eval_01_Usability_smk.org][Expression Eval_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the  Simulation link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the  Simulation page
  3. Click on the Expression Evaluation link
  4. Click on the clear(C) button and enr-ter the valid values and click on "=" button
  5. Click on pause button and click on previous button 
  6. click on play button and the click on the clear(C) button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A new tab should be opened with the simulation process
  4. The result should be displayed on the screen and when we click on the pause button , video should stop playing and when we click on the previous button the previous video should start playing
