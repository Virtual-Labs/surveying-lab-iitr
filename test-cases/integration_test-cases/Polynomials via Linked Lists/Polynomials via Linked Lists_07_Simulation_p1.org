* Objective
  - To view the  Simulation of the Polynomials via Linked Lists experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/data-structures-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Polynomials via Linked Lists/Polynomials via Linked Lists_01_Usability_smk.org][Polynomials via Linked Lists_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the  Simulation link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the  Simulation page
  3. Click on the Polynomial Operations link
  4. Enter the invalid values in the corresponding fields and click on the 'Add' button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A new tab should be opened with the simulation process
  4. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to enter the valid values in  the corresponding fields

* Review/comments
