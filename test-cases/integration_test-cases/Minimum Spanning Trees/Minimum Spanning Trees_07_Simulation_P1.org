* Objective
  - To  simulate the Minimum Spanning Trees experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/data-structures-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Minimum Spanning Trees/Minimum Spanning Trees_01_Usability_smk.org][Minimum Spanning Trees_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the  Simulation link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the  Simulation page
  3. Click on the Graph DFS and BFS link
  4. Follow the tips and perform the simulation 
  5. Click on the Reset button and then click on the clear screen button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A new tab should be opened with the simulation process
  4. The result should be displayed on the screen and when we click on the reset graph button , the graph drawn should be erased 
  5. When we click on the clear board button , all the nodes should be erased and simulation home page should be dispalyed on the screen
